## Linux terminal cmd parser for MCU STM32F407

In this project you can find usart2 and usart3 peripheral settings for stm324f04 disco-board. In the files usart.h and usart.c there is a template for parsing messages. It can easily be modified for any other purpose.

You can contact me for additional questions.
